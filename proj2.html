                        This project aims to explore the Walmart Sales data to understand top performing branches and products, sales trend of different products, customer behaviour.
                        The aims is to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized. 
                        The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

                        In this data analysis project, I undertook a comprehensive approach to enhance the dataset through a series of data wrangling and feature engineering techniques and performed various SQL queries to analyze Data.

                        The primary objective of this project is to gain comprehensive insights into the sales data of Walmart, aiming to understand the various factors influencing the sales performance across its branches. The dataset encompasses sales transactions from three distinct branches situated in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw, comprising 17 columns and 1000 rows. 
                    </li>

                    <li>&rArr; The analysis encompasses three key dimensions: Product Analysis, focusing on product lines' performance and areas for improvement; Sales Analysis, delving into sales trends to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies; and Customer Analysis, seeking to unveil customer segments, purchase trends, and segment profitability.</li>
                    <li>
                        &rArr; The approach involves meticulous data wrangling, database creation, and feature engineering, including the addition of insightful columns such as:
                        <ol>
                            <br><li>&blacksquare; "Time_of_day" to analyze sales during different parts of the day and</li>
                                <li>&blacksquare; "Day_name" and "Month_name" to assess weekly and monthly business patterns, respectively. </li>
                        </ol>
                        The ensuing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aims to provide comprehensive answers to the project's key questions and objectives.
